# Emoji Copy Extension
Have you ever [Google](https://www.google.com/)d the name of an emoji in hopes of copying it but were met with the formatting of the search results which didn't let you select and copy the emoji in plain text easily? Or the emoji wasn't in the search results, forcing you to go on a website like [Emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org/) to copy it? <br><br>
This Chrome Extension injects a box under the Emojipedia.org search result on any Google search which allows the user to copy the respective emoji, as seen in the example below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      <img src="./assets/Light.png">
    </th>
    <th>
      <img src="./assets/Dark.png">
    </th>
  </tr>
</table>
